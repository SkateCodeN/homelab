            <p>This is the custom splash page for the homelab web app. So far
                we have a pfsense firewall installed. On our firewall we have
                a few ports forwarded and we have our DNS passing through cloudflare.
            </p>

                I think this is all happened with my desire to work on IT and
                software related activities. My background is both from IT Networking
                and software development. Now is the time to sort of put it all together,
                to have fun.

                A memory from the past came to me when typing the above. It was in Sacramento
                in my days as a high school student. I was in a CCNA competion for Skills USA.
                The regional jugde was telling me about a student that was running his own
                server at home. Not only that but this person had CISCO switches and routers
                to practice his internetworking skills. I just thought that was the coolest thing.
                Now that I am older, I have the means and knowlege to do the same. To develop an ecosystem
                of software I create. Empashis on starting something. I have a tendancy to not finish my projects.
